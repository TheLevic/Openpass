# A simple python password generator to store passwords locally

### To use this script follow the directions below:

### 1. Clone the repository

### 2. Add your desired file path for your passwords to the parts of the code that says, "Your filepath goes here". Please make sure that you put the file path inside of the quotes.Also please make sure that you include "filename.txt" at the end of your filepath. For example, my path is, "C:\Users\Levi\Desktop\Pw\pw.txt". Otherwise the program will throw an error. Might work fixing this soon.

### If you are confused about the aboave step, please check the levi branch of the repository for an example.

### 3. To run, simply run python main.py

The end goal of this project is to be able to:

- Generate secure passwords
- Add credentials and website info to file
- Encrypt and decrypt this file in a safe way
- Search for desired user information

This will be a slow project, mainly for fun.
